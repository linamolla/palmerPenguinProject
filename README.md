# Predicting Palmer Penguins Species

*Collaborative project from the PIC 16A Python and Computing course taken at UCLA.*

By Lina Molla and Joycelyn Ng

Based on the well known palmer penguins data set, we wanted to create a model that most efficiently and effectively predicts the species of a penguin. In this project, we will walk you through the data cleaning, exploratory data anaylsis, feature selection, model selection, and model optimization that led us to determine the best way to predict the species of the palmer penguins.
